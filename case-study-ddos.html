        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>During my internship at Exposys Data Labs, I was entrusted with developing a scalable DDoS detection system to safeguard network infrastructure from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The project aimed to create an advanced detection mechanism that could handle dynamic, high-volume network traffic in real-time. The primary challenge was to develop a solution that could accurately identify malicious traffic without introducing excessive false positives and with minimal latency.

            </p>

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <section id="problem-statement">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong>DDoS attacks have evolved significantly over the years, becoming more sophisticated and difficult to detect using traditional methods. Attackers employ various techniques such as flooding the network with illegitimate requests, which could potentially overwhelm defenses. The existing systems were either inadequate in real-time detection capabilities or too prone to false alarms due to the imbalance between normal traffic and attacks.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong>The goal was to design a model that could effectively identify DDoS attacks amidst legitimate traffic, ensuring high detection accuracy and low false positive rates. This required an innovative approach that could capture the complex interactions within network data, which is inherently graph-structured.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Approach -->
        <section id="approach">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Modeling Technique:</strong> : I adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model network traffic data. The network traffic was treated as a graph where each data point (network packet) represented a node, and the relationships between packets (such as timestamps and packet types) formed the edges. This approach allowed the model to learn from the graph structure, capturing the intricate patterns in the data that are characteristic of DDoS attacks.
                <h3><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
                </h3>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> Utilized RobustScaler to normalize the features, ensuring the model was not biased towards any particular feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Imbalance Handling:</strong> The dataset was highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of the data representing attacks. I employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, thereby balancing the dataset and mitigating model bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Construction:</strong>The dataset was converted into a graph structure where each node represented a network packet and edges represented temporal relationships and data flow between packets. This transformation enabled the model to learn from the connections within the data, which is crucial for detecting sophisticated attacks.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Entropy Computing:</strong> I utilized Shannon entropy and Renyi entropy for feature engineering, calculating the uncertainty and diversity of network packets to enrich the feature set. This allowed the model to capture subtle differences between normal and attack traffic, improving detection accuracy.</li>            </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Layer 1:</strong> Aggregated features from the immediate neighbors of each node using a mean aggregation strategy. This layer captured local contextual information, essential for understanding packet interactions within the immediate vicinity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Layer 2:</strong> Refined node embeddings using the Graph Attention Network (GAT). This layer allowed each neighbor to have different weights based on its importance to the central node, enhancing the model’s ability to focus on critical features when classifying packets.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Classification Layer:</strong> After refining node embeddings with GAT, the graph’s overall representation was fed into a fully connected layer for classification. This layer classified whether the input data corresponds to normal traffic or a DDoS attack.
